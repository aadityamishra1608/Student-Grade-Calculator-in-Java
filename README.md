# Student-Grade-Calculator-in-Java
A student grade calculator program made using Java language. I've made this project for my Mini Porject in Semester 3 in Second Year. It accepts names, marks, student IDs: and calculates the grade accordingly. User can see the data of a student by simply typing in the Student ID.
